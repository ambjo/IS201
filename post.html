                        <p>My name is Amber Jones and I am a big book and movie nerd! Since I've been little, I have loved getting sucked into a fantasy world of adventure, romance, and the unkown. It is my favorite thing when I find a book I can not put down, or a movie I could watch everyday. There is more to me than just books and movies, so here's a little more about me and my story.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">My History</h2>
                        <p>I am from Gilbert, Arizona! Yes, the summers are as hot as everyone says but the beautiful winter months make up for the suffocating heat. My family consists of my mom and dad and three siblings. Together we love eating treats, playing games, going to Disneyland, and watching movies.  </p>
                        <p>I am currently a student at Brigham Young University, working on getting a degree in accounting. I love learning and this school has definitely pushed me to work hard and streatch myself further than I thought I could.  </p>
                        <p>I recently returned home from a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints. I served 5 months in South Dakots and 1 year in Jamaica. I loved my time as a missionary and it has shaped me to be the person I am today.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Random Favorites</h2>
                        <p>I am a food lover! If there is chocolate in it, I will probably love it! Mexican food is my all time favorite, specifically tacos, but I will never pass up on a good chiken nugget and fries. I am obsessed warm treats with icecream. A warm brownie with icecream on top is supreme and no one can convince me otherwise.</p>
                        <p>I love giraffes and turtles, I don't really know why but I think they are the cutest. Dr. Pepper is the best drink. Ketchup, bananas, and pickles all smell and taste disgusting.</p>
                        <p>I am a big Swiftie. All of her music is amazing. Tell me another artist that can create so my differentgenres of music and still be successful in all of them.</p>
                        <p>Disneyland is one of my favorite places on earth. It truly is a magical place filled with amazing food, thrilling rides, and immersive experiences. My favorite is Guardians of the Galaxy, it is the best feeling during the first frop and your stomach feels like it flew out of your body.</p>
                        <p>My life motto comes from my all-time favorite movie the 2015 "Cinderella."</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Reason Why</h2>                        
                        <p>In all honesty, I started this blog for a project for my Information Systems class. We had to create a website and I thought to make it about something that I love. So here I am, and maybe I'll keep working on it, but probably not.</p>
                                                
                        <h2 class="section-heading">That's all</h2>
                        <p>Well you made it to the end, so you are a real one. Or you just scrolled to the bottom which you are less of a real one. Hope you enjoy this blog that I have created!  </p>
