            <li class="listsposition1">The Harry Potter Series by JK Rowling
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a fantasy, adventure series. If you have not read it, YOU HAVE TOO! I have reread this series so many times.</li> 
                    <li>Entertainment: 10/10 (The world JK Rowling creates is amazing)</li>
                    <li>Romance: 4/10 (there is some relationships, but not a big focus. In the sixth book is when the characters really start developing feelings for other people and it's awkward but so funny)</li>
                    <li>Favorite Characters: I love Ginny in the books (her character is trashed in the movies). Hermione is also top of the list. Fred and George are hilarious so I love them.</li>
                    <li class="textbox"><img src="assets/img/harrypotterbooks.jpg" alt="Harry Potter Books" width="200px" height="200px" style="position: relative; right: -550px;"></li>
                </ul>
            </li>            
            <li class="listsposition1">The Selection Series by Kiera cass
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a dystopian, romance series. Also important note - I only loved the first three books (the last two are with other characters and I was not a fan) </li> 
                    <li>Entertainment: 7/10 (it is basically the Bachelor combined with Hunger Games so action and excitment was definitely there)</li>
                    <li>Romance: 7/10 (love the relationship that develops between the two characters - it is rocky but real) </li>
                    <li>Favorite Characters: Prince Maxon is my favorite but I also love Marlee (a friend)</li>
                    <li class="textbox"><img src="assets/img/theselectionseries.webp" alt="The Selection Series Books" width="350px" height="170px" style="position: relative; right: -400px;"></li>
                </ul>
            </li>            
            <li class="listsposition1">The Lunar Chronicles by Marissa Meyer
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a fantasy, dystopian series. Each book is about a different girl based off of a different fairytale story. All of their stories connect with each other and it is so fun to see the connections between the characters and the fairytale they are based on.</li> 
                    <li>Entertainment: 9/10 (With each new character added, the exctiemnt, thrill, and adventure grows greater and greater)</li>
                    <li>Romance: 10/10 (there are 4 different relationships and each of them are beautifula dn unique in their own way)</li>
                    <li>Favorite Characters: Cinder and Prince Kai are my favorite (they are the cinderella fairytale twist). I also love Thorne (He is FLyn Rider in the Rapunzel story so he's the best)</li>
                    <li class="textbox"><img src="assets/img/lunarchronicles.jpg" alt="Lunar Chronicles series books" width="250px" height="270px" style="position: relative; right: -500px;"></li>

            <li class="listsposition1">Cinderella (2015)
                <ul>
                    <li>This is the live action Cinderella movie Disney made and it was so well done. They did such an amazing job with the character development and adding the well-known story</li> 
                    <li>Entertainment: 10/10 (the dancing scene is beautiful. Don't get me started on the dress transformation - literal perfection)</li>
                    <li>Romance: 10/10 (wow. The chemistry between Kit and Cinderella is beautiful) </li>
                    <li>Favorite Characters: Cinderella of course (Lily James does a magnificent job portraying her) and the Prince of course (just look at those eyes)</li>
                    <li>My all time favorite quote comes from this movie, it is said by Cinderella's mother "Have courage and be Kind."</li>

            <li class="listsposition1">Crazy Rich Asians
                <ul>
                    <li>This is a romcom and it is hilarious and so romantic</li> 
                    <li>Entertainment: 7/10 (a crazy family, lots of drama, and a beautiful wedding scene)</li>
                    <li>Romance: 9/10 (They are so cute and the love they have for each other is so pure) </li>
                    <li>Favorite Characters: Rachel is so cool. Peik Lin is played by Awkwifina so her character is hilarious. Astrid is so pure and wholesome.</li>
